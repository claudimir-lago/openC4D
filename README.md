#### _A Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detector (C4D) for Capillary Electrophoresis._

To the best of our knowledge, this is still the smallest Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detector (C4D) … and it’s open!

Our first C4D was introduced in 1998 [1], and after trials and errors, we published an improved version in 2009 [2]. Here, the continuously improved version is available.

What is here?

•	The plans to build __the printed circuit boards for the detector__ itself. It must be powered, and the signal is available as a digital output in a serial format.

•	__The microcontroller board.__ Although the detector module can be used in a dedicated instrument, this board allows one to control up to four C4Ds through a USB port.

•	__The firmware.__ An Arduino firmware to be used in the microcontroller board.

•	__The frontend.__ A Java frontend to be used to get electropherograms.
