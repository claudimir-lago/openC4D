This microcontroller board allows you to connect up to four openC4Ds to an USB port. Then, you can use the [frontend](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/openC4D/tree/master/frontend) for data acquisition or send [Serine commands](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/openC4D/blob/master/firmware/Manual_openC4D_3.pdf) using a [terminal program](https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/).

The original version of the board is based on a [Teensy 2.0 board](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html), and the one-layer PCB was created in [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download). Unfortunately, Teensy 2.0 was discontinued. So, for new projects, consider the Arduino-shield version.
