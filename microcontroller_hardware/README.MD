This microcontroller board allows you to connect up to four openC4Ds to an USB port. Then, you can use the frontend for data acquisition or send [Serine commands](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/openC4D/blob/master/firmware/Manual_openC4D_3.pdf) using a [terminal program](https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/).

The board is based on a [Teensy 2.0 board](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html), which is put in a socket on our PCB board and, thus, you don’t have to solder all those SMD parts…

The one-layer PCB was created in [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download).
