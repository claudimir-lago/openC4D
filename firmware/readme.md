The firmware was developed on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform using [Serine Protocol](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/Serine-Protocol). The available version is based on a Teensy 2.0 board. We hope to deploy versions for an Arduino board soon.

The [manual](https://github.com/claudimir-lago/openC4D/blob/master/firmware/Manual_openC4D_3.pdf) allows you developing a frontend in any language. Actually, you can use just a terminal program to send ASCII messages and get C4D data.
