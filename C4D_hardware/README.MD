# Building an openC4D
#### _The basics about what you have here._

The openC4D is composed of four printed circuit boards (PCBs): the oscillator, the rectifier, and two shielding boards. Inside the folders Oscillator and Rectifier, you will find the schematics and PCB images. The original files were made in [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/).

Whether you wish a fast track, go straight to Gerber and send the files to some place for the production of a panel with PCBs for one complete openC4D.

#### _An warning about the previous version of the printed circuit board_
The previous version of the PCBs was made available as a panel with the boards for three detectors. There was, however, a small but important failure in the tracks. Unfortunately, two tracks were merged in some point during the production, and now they must be fixed. Figure 1 shows that board and the two small cuts that must be done in the oscillator board. You can use a sharp (and hard) device to cut the merged tracks… and that’s all.
