The openC4D is composed of four printed circuit boards (PCBs): the oscillator, the rectifier, and two shielding boards. Inside the folders Oscillator and Rectifier, you will find the schematics and PCB images. The original files were made in [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/).

Whether you wish a fast track, go straight to Gerber and send the files to some place for the production of a panel with PCBs for one complete openC4D.

#### _A Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detector (C4D) for Capillary Electrophoresis._

To the best of our knowledge, this is still the smallest Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity Detector (C4D) … and it’s open!

Our first C4D was introduced in 1998 [1], and after trials and errors, we published an improved version in 2009 [2]. Here, the continuously improved version is available.

What is here?

•	The plans to build __the printed circuit boards for the detector__ itself. It must be powered, and the signal is available as a digital output in a serial format.
