The openC4D is composed of four printed circuit boards (PCBs): the oscillator, the rectifier, and two shielding boards. Inside the folders Oscillator and Rectifier, you will find the schematics and PCB images. The original files were made in [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/).

Whether you wish a fast track, go straight to Gerber and send the files to some place for the production of a panel with PCBs for three complete openC4Ds. This 10x10cm panel is more convenient for mass production.
